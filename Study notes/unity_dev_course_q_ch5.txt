This was most difficult so far.

This material property causes polygons to appear and light as if they had more surface detail:
- Emission
- Metallic
√ Normal
- Smoothness

This material rendering mode uses black in an alpha channel to define where a material is exactly NOT appearing:
- Transparency
- Fade
- Opaque
√ Cutout 

The albedo of a material is defined as:
- The diffuse color of the material in general light
- The blocking of bounced light by adjacent surfaces
- A raw diffuse color before any weathering is applied
√ The color of the material without any lighting data

This material property controls spreading of light on microsurface detail:
- Metallic
- Normal
- Ambient Occlusion
√ Smoothness

The specular property of a material:
√ Controls the color and strength of reflection
- Controls the spreading of light on microsurface detail
- Defines where surfaces will receive high or low amounts of indirect light
- Modifies the surface to show more detail than the polygons actually have
